NAME
	sudoso - a shell-based SUDOku SOlver, written in Python
SYNTAX and CLI-OPTIONS
	If you want to solve a sudoku, you must specify it as the first argument. 
	Write this line for line from top to bottom, from left to right, without spaces.
	 Write numbers you don't know as a '0'
	You may seperate the lines with semicolons, sudoso can then better tell you where your typos are.
	Command-line-options are as following:

	-c,--count	Only count the solutions
	-v,--verbose	Verbose mode, will tell you how it solved the sudoku
	-s,--stepper	Stepper mode, will wait for a keypress after every solving step
	-d,		Deterministic mode, will not give a solution if it would have to guess to solve the sudoku
	-l,--

EXAMPLE
	Try the included testsudokus "testfile1" and "testfile2". 
	Type ./sudoso.py `cat testfile1`
